Based on the Webkit style

C++ codes files end in ".cc", header files end in ".hh" - lowercase file names prefered.

Spaces not tabs (never tabs)

Line length limit: 128 characters

3 character indent

Spaces and else usage: usually like this:

   int a = 1;
   if (a < 10) {
      // something
   } else {
      // something else
   }

except in the for loop, where the spaces around the operator are removed:

   for (int i=0; i<10; i++) {
   }

std::cout:

   std::cout << "first thing"
             << "aligned on the <<"
             << std::endl;

Never pass by reference (non-const reference) unless the function which you are calling
is less than 30 lines of code away (in which case it is allowed, but not prefered), i.e.
variables that are modified by a function are marked by passing a pointer (variable_p)
or &variable (preferably the later).
