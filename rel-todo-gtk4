Coot: Pull in Bernhard's Rama plots
* Done.

libcootapi: import gltf (from Mol*, say!)

Coot: update molecule when input model file have updates?

Coot: Why do we need requests? Can't it be done by libcurl or internal python module urllib?
      See fetch_drug_via_wikipedia() in coot_utils.

Coot: rsr_refine_all_atoms() only refines the chain
* Done.

Coot: (refinement) martin maly bug: transpose map by lsq superpose failed.
      Bring the lsq map function to libcootapi and chapi
* Done

Coot: I want to be able to add a DNA base to the end of a fragment, with or without density.
      (Restore functionality).
* Done.

Coot: 4qpq: It is making DNA base pair restraints as I hoped?
* Seems so from the behaviour, but I don't see it in the terminal

Coot: Ribbons mode needs (an option?) to add ligands 6zxa.cif

Coot: for sound, look at tw/cootsound.c

Coot: on the command line, coot --dict thing.cif should give a molecule, not just read in the cif
      if there are no coordinates arguments.

Coot: add a means to say that P1 maps can have symmetry:
   https://github.com/pemsley/coot/issues/67

Layla: Garib: I want the ability to change charge and bond orders.
    Also: See this: http://rdkit.blogspot.com/2019/11/introducing-new-rdkit-javascript.html
    which points to this: https://rdkit.org/rdkitjs/beta/demo.html

Test ligand fitting of fitligand binary. Using conformation variation and not.

libcootapi: what do we need to get flev working?

libcootapi: give me tautomers of this molecule/ligand.

chapi: what about bringing servalcat into the chapi installation? And to build-it-3-3?

libcootapi: in protein_geometry add a function something like
   duplicate_dictionary_for_other_molecule(int idx_rest, int imol_other)
   so that dictionaries assigned to a particular molecule can be used by other molecules (e.g. in dragged refinement).
   The molecules_container api will be duplicate_dictionary_for_other_molecule(comp_id, imol_current, imol_other)

libcootapi: when generating conformers, throw away the conformers that hamve many nbs (dont do minimization)

libcootapi: move secondary structure header info int SSEs of residue (does this function exist already?)

libcootapi: remove the sphere test when generating map contours.

libcootapi: remove static things in the molecules_container

libcootapi: make auto-fit-rotamer work without a map (if it doesn't already)

libcootapi: hydrogen bonds to a residue?

Coot: Save Coords is not working again.
* It works OK, on mac, so I think that it's a GTK4 bug.

Coot: "Close" button doesn't work in Restraints editor.

Coot: look at the 2b0m flavin ligand interactions - diego where it looks like a hydrogen bond.

Coot: what does electrostactics give us now?

For next week: local resolution display in Moorhen

"thread fill sections" - is debugging I think - get rid of it.

libcootapi: set_user_defined_atom_colour_by_selection() should not be given a vector of pairs,
  it should be a vector of triples (trivial class) { selection_string, colour_index, Cs-only-flag }

libcootapi: what happens when the ligands dont't match?

libcootapi: put gesamt into the build (build-it-3-3)

libcootapi: change the SSM arg order to match ligand function: moving first.

libcootapi: to release std::vector memory use std::swap on an empty vector, not mere assignment

libcootapi: add function for delete by B-factor or plddt - limit goes both ways

libcootapi: bring in transpose map by lsq superposition

libcootapi: check the return type/value of match_torsion_and_postion()
* Done. It's not clever.

libcootapi: non-carbon rules should be per rule not per molecule

libcootapi: environ distances are not symmetry aware - they should be. Q: are they in Coot?

libcootapi: /Users/pemsley/Projects/Moorhen/checkout/coot-1.0/api/add-terminal-residue.cc:9:9: warning: 'HAVE_BOOST_BASED_THREAD_POOL_LIBRARY' macro redefined [-Wmacro-redefined]

libcootapi: delete all the molecules that are closed at the end of the list (delete, not close)
* Done.

libcootapi: to release std::vector memory use std::swap on an empty map, not mere assignment
* Done

libcootapi: make minimize_energy() return a mesh, like std::pair<int, coot::instanced_mesh_t> refine(int imol, int n_cycles)
 does. And the GSL return status.
* Done

libcootapi: nice to have position restraints for ligand+env minimization

libcootapi: are backups being made by refine()?. If so, turn them off - maybe backup at start?

libcootapi: pull bernhards repo for new ramas

libcootapi: before Newcastle: torsion match ligand and ligand graph-based superposition
 * Done - but needs more work

libcootapi: the apply colour rules to non-carbon atoms need to happen on a per-colour-rule basis, not per molecule.
  so that ligands can be set a different colour in Goodsel mode - and goodsel mode plays nicely with other colour rules.

libcootapi fix the apply_user_defined_atom_colour_selections() so that it uses atoms, not residue selection.

libcootapi: remove ligands and waters

libcootapi: renumber residue range

libcootapi: make an ensemble from a list of molecules

M2T: /Users/runner/work/coot/coot/MoleculesToTriangles/CXXSurface/CXXSurface.cpp:356:5: warning: 'sprintf' is deprecated: This function is provided for compatibility reasons only.

look at every HIS in the PDB, look at the difference map - looking for hydroxy prolines

findwaters: can the output file be mmcif? - Eugene

findligands: can the output file be mmcif? - Eugene

libcootapi: create_n_empty_molecules() so that molecules indexes match
* Done.

libcootapi: draw bonds from struct_conn info.

mmdb: add SSBOND information into a struct_conn object - read and write.

Add test data test-molecules-container 6gdg.cif emd_32143.map ATP.cif G37.cif 1phk-with-gap.pdb
   moorhen-tutorial-structure-number-1-with-gap.pdb 203d.pdb.gz weird-orientation-tut-4.pdb
* Done.

Install the ui files from a relative directory, not relative to phackage_data_dir()
Likewise the standard residues.
# no need. Just setenv COOT_DATA_DIR

Coot: edit_chi_angles_reverse_fragment_togglebutton is missing
* Done.

Coot: environment distances (when turned on) are shown when sliding (to the next water), but
not when jumping.

chapi: make overlap information available

Coot: add a warning when trying to save a PDB file with a 5-char residue/ligand

libcootapi: draw links from struct conn information in a mmdb::Manager.

validate that the seqres record match the residue type. (Editing the seqres is another thing)

chapi: test refine_residues_using_atom_cid() with "sphere" - for Paul Bond, this causes a crash.
* Can't reproduce in test-molecules-container.cc

libcootapi: can I make a nanobinding that returns a minmol residue, and another for atom?

libcootapi: turn_off_backups(imol). This needs some infrastucture work. Add something like
   really_do_make_backups_flag to coot::molecule_t - and that is set by the above function call.

libcootapi: bus error on change_chain_id - reported by Filo, I think. Is on Moorhen Project board?

libcootapi: add mini-rsr to the CMake build
* Done

libcootapi: fix the link problem from Andrey
* Hopefully done.

libcootapi: CMake should check for dw and elf

moorhen: void atom in mmdb mmcif output.
* Stuart saw the problem in mmdb - not acted on yet.

moorhen: search monomer library for ARG with methyl (for example)
* This presumes that the monomer library names are available.

libcootapi: bring regularization to the api

libcootapi: add a mc function to set_rotamer_tables_compressed_data()
* Needed? Why not read a file, like read_ccp4_map() does?

libcootapi: (?) bundle the reference structures into the source code.

libcootapi: fix the oversized MG atoms in Goodsell mode 1ttt
* Done.

libcootapi: can set_user_defined_bond_colours be passed RGBA values?
* Seems not. Why not though?

libcootapi: add label_seq_id etc for the residue added in add_terminal_residue

libcootapi: add refinement control parameters to molecules_container,
       torsion weight, rama weight, gm weight and whatever others.

libcootapi: how do I turn on Rama refinement?
* Done.

libcootapi: work out the arguments for MT2 mesh as glTF.
* Done.

libcootapi: add a function to copy a map (and a model molecule I guess) for figure making.

libcootapi: replace_molecule_by_model_from_file() should be passed the use_gemmi argument.

libcootapi: See Filo pull request and write a c++ test-molecules-container test for gltf.
* Done.

moorhen: SMILES: nitrobezene svg ligand rep - charge position size offset of the + and - neeeds

Coot: on a rainy day: remove the static GtkWidget *dialogs.

Coot: check the spin speed in Edit Chi Angles on a trackpad.

Coot: does single-model-view work?

Coot: on ligand fitting, use conformers and get "no ligands selected" dialog

Coot: Add "Scene Preset" -> Model Building, Figure Making. Test Perspective also

Coot: colour-by-molecule has big atoms - why? Fix.

Coot: Fitting ligands "Installing Ligand Conformers" dialog should be an overlay

Coot: on fitting ligands, I get a dialog "WARNING:: No ligands were selected"

Coot: Fix this in pyrogen Makefile:
      SWIG_FLAGS = -DSWIG -DCOOT_USE_GTK2_INTERFACE
      Is -DSWIG already on, because it's parsed by swig?
* Done.

Coot: set_colour_by_chain(0) has missing name space in 0-coot.state.py
   "coot" is being added to display_strings, not active_strings?

libcootapi: what are the headers? Including Remark records?

libcootapi:
   //! generate GM self restraints for the given residues.
   //! `residue_cids" is a "||"-separated list of residues, e.g. "//A/12||//A/14||/B/56"
   void generate_local_self_restraints(int imol, float local_dist_max,
                                       const std::string &residue_cids);
   Make this use "normal" multi-cids
* Done, I think.

moorhen: reading a map often the default (first) contour level is too low.
e.g. the map of 8ox5. Lucrezia to investigate?

moorhen SMILES: nitrobezene svg ligand rep - charge position size offset of the + and - neeeds
  to be fixed.

libcootapi:
  get rid of #define HAVE_BOOST_BASED_THREAD_POOL_LIBRARY in add-terminal-residue.cc

libcootapi: look at merging 7ZTVU (or whatever it was) into a cif file. Look at the output cif for
   ligand: atom_site seq_id.
   Merge a ligand with a long ligand name into a molecule from a PDB file, then try to refine the ligand.

CMakefile/libcootapi: add findligands and findwaters to CMakeLists.txt - Charles

findligands: try with 5-char ligand in 1cxq and write a cif. Eugene says that it fails. Does it?

Nice to have: add a SSBOND to a PDB or cif and it does the check that the residues are there and adds the record.

ligand figures from the chem_comp_atom_depiction_t
* Semi done, need to work in the Coot part also.

MMDB: Look at mmdb chain selection. Can you remove chain range?
      chain-id range test: Look at assembly cif for examples of chain-range-like chain-ids.
      Use one of them for an atom selection test.
      Tweak ParseSelectionPath().

libcootapi: dependencies clipper:
   $ egrep ' -L=/' $prefix/lib/lib*.la
   Needs fixing. Configuring and building clipper solo, the la files do not show this problem.
   But they do from the build-it-3-3 script? (needs testing from fresh).

libcootapi: #include <GL/gl.h> in CXXSurface/CXXVCN.h - remove it if you can.

   #ifndef __NVCC__
   #ifdef HAVE_BOOST
   #define HAVE_BOOST_BASED_THREAD_POOL_LIBRARY
* Done.

libcootapi: Bring HOLE to the api - and possibly map carving.

libcootapi: cif parsing: let's have the acedrg version of gphl_chem_comp_info

// This needs a look. When did I comment this out? And why?
ligand/residue_by_phi_psi.hh:// #define HAVE_BOOST_BASED_THREAD_POOL_LIBRARY
Can I use residue_by_phi_psi multi-threaded?

Moorhen: Ligand fitting return a triple of the cluster index, the ligand index and the molecule index.
         Ligand solutions have the same position + orientation with even without conformers!

Moorhen: Set a flag for contouring timers. Add them, store the result, and use the flag to get the times.
         Does the contouring write any output? If so, remove it.
* Done.

Bug:: the dialog for selection of column labels from an mtz file is broken,
      can't assign weights, can't assign Fobs.

Bug:: Missing GUI: Rigid-body fit Residue Ranges
* Done.

Bug: 7adk peptide omega plot "" chain is empty. Presumably a libcootapi problem.

GUI: Look at the terminal output when using the Preferences dialog. Is it all needed?

GUI: Geman-McClure alpha refinement params box menu doesn't show the correct value.

GUI: Update the validation box when "flip peptide" button is pressed.
     Does the updating map update in this case?

GUI: Add a Cryo-EM menu item for solidify maps (currently in coot_gui.py). Don't use python.

GUI: Ctrl-A, Ctrl-E in the python command line

GUI: easier way to set default b-factor: set_default_temperature_factor_from_median()

GUI: If python command fails, I want to somehow see that it failed.

GUI: Rotate/Translate <fragment> doesn't work.

GUI: see a validation graph (geometry) with one chain (e.g. A chain fragment from tutorial-modern).
     The residue labels were getting chopped in half.

GUI: Renumber residue range on a molecule that is not the first molecule ::: 0.6

GUI: Replace-residue is missing. Needs a UI. Make it an overlay.

GUI: Needs a "Trackpad Mode" button in the UI. It should have a "save this mode" button also.

GUI: Fetch Alphafold model that is closest to the sequence of this chain.

     Do the same thing.

GUI: Cryo-EM module: Add Toggle switch for auto-recontour map

GUI: Add curmudgeon-mode ("Particles and Textures Off") in Preferences dialog.

Graphics: Don't draw rama ball when intermediate atoms are from edit chi angles (and some
   others presumably).

Graphics: Check that the Gaussian surface is being displayed before drawing it for the
   SSAO frame-buffer.

Graphics: Fast slide to new position on reading in a new molecule (there is a distance limit
   that means there's a jump - don't use that for read_pdb()).

Graphics: Don't draw rama balls when intermediate atoms are from edit chi angles (and
          some others presumably).

Graphics: Rigid-body refine the tutorial A chain. It used to display an intermediate

libcootapi: bring conformer generation to the api. Do energy minimization and discard the
     high energy conformers

Fun: flattening difference map peaks animation:
        find peak and negative peaks in the
        current diff-map - previous diff-map difference map
        Use those peaks for particle animation.
        Make a moorhen function for these.

Fun: Add pops.

Science: Load JSG.cif from the RCSB and Get Monomer, run acedrg and load the the dictionary.
     Some of the Hydrogen atoms get disconnected on regularization.
     Why? (Note that the "Get Monomer" from the acedrg dictionary works OK - no flying Hydrogen atoms).

Science: Get the Cryo-EM servalcat difference map working

Science: analytical gradients for Gaussian surfaces

Science: Make a exponential_approx function that uses a pre-calculated table
         and use it to make smooth normals for the vertices of a gaussian surface.
         Extra points for multi-threading.

Useful: multi-thread the rmsd calculation, so that the Coot points
        calculation in cryo-EM maps is fast(er).

Science: middle of blob for EM jiggle-fitting, try 3908?

Science: "One button" post-jiggle fit "black box morph refine"

   o Lessen blur
   o Refine
   Tricky thing is to find interesting cases.

Science/Useful: Calculate the RSR contact dots only for atoms with in ~12 A (say) of the
   centre of the screen.

Fix this in api/coot_molecule_maps.cc: Test N-threads in Moorhen:

---- older issues ---

Auto-centre the user-suggestion for the centre of the blob when using
jiggle-fit. c.f. "Place Helix Here" initial centering.

Typical example of "what to do?"
  - Filo has been trying the Coot EM tutorial in Moorhen and finds some problem with
    "jiggle fit" - this is an interesting scientific problem - how far can you be away
  - Bogged down in tracking events and model coordinates and mesh and drawing updates
    for rotation/translation
  - Chatting with Jakub about Shortcuts but making no progress

Ribbons don't cast shadows.

No reaction to Aligment vs PIR (no PIR was loaded)

Size and user-defined "screen axis" displacement of atom labels, e.g. [0,0,5] to bring
the label towards the camera.

Issue 67:
On reflection, I will add a function that allows the user to override Coot's attempt to determine the EM-state of the map.

Layla: make python setup be available for Coot and Layla - put it in its own directory. So that layla
is not linked with src files.

Rob's problematic links
* Need details.

startup with default map opacity.

Jakub: sugar representation in RDKit and layla? (add it?) Tricky.

Where is Make Link? ::: 1.5
* Needs user-defined click click. Just do it in C++?
* Note that Make Link via Acedrg also needs user-defined click click (or a rewrite).

Colour rules (like Moorhen) need to be added to the Coot API.

Rewrite moorhen ligand fitting to use a vector of threads, not the thread pool.
* Low priority

Pyrogen needs to work ::: 2

Greg Crichlow cifs

Full-fat render path - i.e. framebuffer need to be set up correctly (at the right time?) ::: 2
set_framebuffer_scale_factor().
Well this works just like gtk3 version does. No effect on the framebuffer using "Fancy" path and
shows a quadrant in "Plane" mode. The output tga file is full-resolution though, which is nice.
Don't confuse the scaling of the framebuffer for screenshot (in "Plain" mode) and
the scaling of the framebuffers for super-sampling (in "Fancy" mode).
OK, so the framebuffer scaling works in simple mode.
Make it work in "fancy" mode and I will call it done.

Missing Bernie cherries

Fix build for St Judes Walid

2koc: do a Coot contact dots analysis on it.

Try using the instanced bonds using the api. Fix the specular lighting.

Test the conversion of glm quaternion to coot quaternion and back again. OK, done.
Test are in place. Now try again with the ligand orientation.

What about coot --no-graphics?

What about coot --version?

Fix crash on coot.coot_real_exit(0)
OK, so framebuffers are being deconstructed after call to exit().
It seem that framebuffers need to be deconstructed while the GL context is valid.
So it seems to me that they should be deconstructed as graphics_info_t is deconstructed. So add
their teardown() functions to ~graphics_info_t(). That prevents the crash I think.
However, the init_joey_ssao_stuff() are not initializing SSAO-gBuffer-framebuffer and effects-framebuffer
it seems. Yet they are being bound somewhere. Investigate further later by turning on fancy mode.
See partial-patch-for-framebuffer-teardown.patch.
Now I will revert.

Put the gtk version in the build_type? Currently Linux-x86_64-ubuntu-21.10-gtk4

I want to be able use "Fancy" shader path, but not use SSAO.

Rotation in Proportional Editing

Do we get Diegos for bad backbone neightbours O3' bumping int 05'? We
would need them for validating RNA backbone torsions.

Colour by chain (and dict?) but not by atom - i.e. how colour-by-chain used to work. This gives us
a nicer representation of ribosomes.

Use a state script for 2 model molecules - the first of which is undisplayed. The display manager
doesn't show that it's undisplayed ::: 0.6

Restore the draw() function in draw_ghost_bonds() in molecule-class-info.cc - needs a new class to do so.

In Moorhen, it's nice to work with the contact dots on. When I improve the fit and remove a clash, I want
to see something like the Moorhen points (but for the clash score, of course).

Make auto_read_mtz return the column labels - for Moorhen.

l28. Tried and failed. Test the conversion of glm quaternion to coot quaternion and back again.

Nice to have: Write a script that finds functions in glade-callbacks that are no longer used
(i.e. not in coot-gtk4.ui)

Nice to have: Unmodelled blobs are labelled with the residue to which they are closest.

Nice to have: 1E9 is not correctly horizontally adjusted.

Nice to have: Eleanor: (maybe not for here): How do I find the peaks of this map?

Go To (next) Ligand should use the correct matrix ::: 0.5
perpendicular_ligand_view() is the function. Does it work in gtk3? No.
* Tried and failed. Need to check conversion of quaterions between coot::quaterion and glm::quaternion.

Notes: GTK4 is needed for Vulkan and Vulkan is need for AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution and Nvidia thing (name?)

Alt-B (or Ctrl-B) to close the Validatin/Rama bar.

Make info_dialog() take a string.

Contact dots should be oriented so that when they pulse, they move along the line between the atoms. :::- 1
Also, elongate them? Not vdw dots though.

Sort the triangles so that the difference map looks OK in plain mode. Maybe this should go
above the line?

Nice to have: on a grey background, atom labels work well, but the distance labels do not.

Low Priority: history searching on python window up-arrow :::- 1

Think of a way to start-up with certain modules on (in Preferences) :::- 2
* Nice to have, not vital. Use the command line in the meantime.

Enable the command line (e.g. --pdb and others) :::- 2
* It's actually not clear that I need it!

Find a home for New molecule by sphere :::- 1

Find a home for New molecule by symmetry op :::- 1

Add base paring: on_other_tools_base_pair_toggle_button_toggled() :::- 0.5

I'd like to put coot_utils into coot so that it's coot.utils, likewise coot_gui, fitting etc.

struct_conn in mmdb for links : how  does it work and can they be displayed?

How about "Both" surface and lines for maps? Extra "Both" radio button.

Download 7a0l (or anything) doesn't have (doesn't display) links when reading from an mmcif!
OK, but this is a mmdb problem not a GTK4 Coot problem.

A benchmark in Curlew? Or built-in would be better.

Unmodelled blobs should have an "Update" button :::- 1

Caps lock key indicator?

Coot contact dots updated on model modification

residue spec -> rdkit python object at the coot api

How to represent a "Both" chirial (ambiguous) (are they the same thing?)

User-defined menus in Python - connected via coot_main_menumodel.

Comboboxes with entries for old molecule, or duplicated entries.

Map Skeletonization :::- 4

CA Baton Mode :::- 4

Recompile molecule-class-info-widget-work.cc and remove the compilation warnings :::- 6
* There's a lot of symmetry and NCS stuff in there that needs a large reworking.

End-caps on the O half bonds on the HOHs in 7a0l.

Fullscreen - maybe not possible in gtk4 :::- 0.2

Map Properties window close button :::- 0.5
* I had a look. Not sure what internal-child="action_area" means.

New Mesh algorithms:

https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/engineering/isosurface-extraction

Low Priority: think how to put the "Display Manager" into the main window :::- 6

Low Priority: "Add hydrogens using Refmac" should not cause a lock up - give me a nice progress bar :::- 4

Low Priority: How can I make a flatpak for Coot?

Find somewhere for auto-weight refinement coot_utils.auto_weight_for_refinement()

Pointer distances:  It should be an overlay one day

Coot Info dialog:  It should be an overlay one day

Note: 7UMH is beasty that would look good rendered with colour-by-NCS-related chains (and vdw balls).

void HUDTextureMesh::setup_buffers() { ...
// std::cout << "::::::::::: HUDTextureMesh::setup_buffers() " << name << " vao " << vao << std::endl;
Turn this on and do a RSR, see that the Button Texture meshes have a new vao for each draw!  :::- 1
* It will do for now these are HUD text. One day rewrite, but not today.

Dotted Surface :::- 1
* This exists and it draws OK, but I don't see how to change the colour yet.
  Changing the colour is very tricky beacuse balls is not part of the coot::dots_representation_info_t
  class. Perhaps it should be? (see add_dots()).

Undo molecule chooser should be an overlay.

"Accent Background" - 1: replace the blank background with a texture. 2: Make a texture using the current image
and blur it either using a framebuffer or by FFTing the image, truncating it and back transforming it (that
would allow the manipulation of the phases so that the background could morph (that might involve pre-generating
a number of textures and interpolating between them). Also consider a blurred textured blue background so that
it looks like the sea.  Or use texture background while Refmac is running.

Low Priority: 3D Annotations :::- 3
Nice to have: 3D text - related to model bulding last time. Or markers in 3D which give us a nice overlay
text annotations.

RCrane - Make this a Module. Fixing this will take a long time. :::- 20

When adding a water "WARNING:: new atom addition blocked by nearby atom" needs a visual cue (red sonar)
on the atom that is blocking. :::- 1

Light Mode, Dark Mode, Automatic (tracks background colour) :::- 1
Put this in preferences.

Change the colour of the Dotted Surface
* This exits and it draws OK, but I don't see how to change the colour yet.
  Changing the colour is very tricky beacuse balls is not part of the coot::dots_representation_info_t
  class. Perhaps it should be? (see add_dots()).

Update Dynamic validation on making links (the NBC clashes should disappear)

7a0l colour by B-factor with fat bonds. Bonds to hydrogen atoms are grey and fat. :::- 5
Also, waters are too big. Also waters are too big in colour by molecule.
Bonds to hydrogen/deuteriums are too fat "Colour by Occupancy" and "Colour by B-factor all".
Bonds to deuteriums in HOH are too fat in (default) "colour by atom" mode.
(also affects gtk3 coot - so think about fixing it there?).
See "fat atom" commits.

How should the "model representation change" work? Ctrl Shift 2-finger scroll? :::- 0.5
* This is too complicated and estoeric to fix now. I don't even know how to fix it.

AWC chirality in the ring - wedge bond is pointing in the wrong direction? Nice example of sp2 Se-ring (not aromatic)

Open dictionary should provide a widget to specify the molecule for dictionary.

No longer. But make the startup window wider. now app window is 1000x900.

Dotted Surface ::: 1
* This exits and it draws OK, but I don't see how to change the colour yet.
  Changing the colour is very tricky beacuse balls is not part of the coot::dots_representation_info_t
  class. Perhaps it should be? (see add_dots()).

7a0l.cif doesn't load from the command line (related to 7a0l-assembly.cif non-load, I guess).
It's a molecule not a dictionary. The command_line::add() function needs to detect the difference.
All molecule .cif files fail to load on the command line? e.g. 7uv7
Now, should this be "nice to have" or "must have"?
* Done.

Sharpen/Blur (mtz) map is missing ::: 1

Built-in key-binding for [,]. ::: 0.2

Open, close, reopen Bond Parameters, An extra molecule combobox is added. ::: 0.5

Check the links in all representation types (use PDB files) ::: 2

* It works on the PC.
* Error in the shader.

Where are the rotating hydrogen bonds? ::: 0.5
Calculate -> Hydrogen Bonds?

7a0l colour by B-factor with fat bonds. Bonds to hydrogen atoms are grey and fat. ::: 2
* Fat bonds partial fix for B-factor and Occ modes.

Apply the symmetry colour from the Cell and Symmetry dialog ::: 1
* Done. At last. 2 attempts. Looks nice.

Save state via a file chooser dialog and Ctrl-S and use on the command line ::: 1
* Done.

This function needs an extra arg: "bool transfered_colour_is_instanced"
void
Mesh::draw_instanced(Shader *shader_p,

                     const glm::mat4 &view_rotation_matrix,
                     const std::map<unsigned int, lights_info_t> &lights,
                     const glm::vec3 &eye_position, // eye position in view space (not molecule space)
                     const glm::vec4 &background_colour,
                     bool do_depth_fog,
                     bool do_pulse,
                     bool do_rotate_z,

                     float pulsing_phase_distribution,
                     float z_rotation_angle)

which gets sent to the shader of course. Check that both interactive atomic comtact dots and hydrogen bonds work.
(what else uses that shader?)   ::: 1
* Done.

7a0l-assemby.cif from rscb.org fails to import. Hmm! How to fix that!? Test case for gemmi-based import?

* Done.

Sort out whatever is going wrong with the display of the extra distance restraints. ::: 1
* Done.

Connect up the distances and angles dialog ::: 1
* It was easy. I could improve the position of the angle label.

Fix the double reading of the monomer library ::: 0.3
* Hopefully this won't break things.

Update the Ramachandran Plot after RSR or other model edits ::: 1
* Done. Nice.

Update the Validation Graphs after RSR or other model edits ::: 2.5
what is this: update_active_validation_graph_model()?
It is the function that gets called when the user changes the molecule in the validation graph dialog.
It is not the function to update the graphs when the model changes.

Validation graph colours ::: 1.0
* Mostly done. Needs some tweaking (e.g. in Density Correlation there needs to be some improved range).

Edit Restraints, Select Monomer type - dialogs messed up ::: 1

* Done.

Calculate -> Map Tools -> Copy Map doesn't work ::: 0.5
* Done. And smoother versions.

* Grindy finding the bug (was not editing the correct dictionary).

rename draw-2.cc as tick-function.cc or some such

On changing the selection in the rama plot, it says "now do something with //A". So you should do that. ::: 0.5

Rama plots need to read the imol in on_ramachandran_plot_molecule_chooser_ok_button_clicked() ::: 0.1

Go into perspective project and with left-mouse pressed wave around the mouse wildly ::: 0.2
*Done. Added stabilization in mouse_zoom().

* Done ages ago.

Do the tutorial from time to time - what's missing? ::: 6

"Add atom" should boink if the new atom is over/close to an already existing atom ::: 0.5
(Maybe it does already)
* Now I get a warning dialog - good enough

Draw the ligand chemical diagram in OpenGL. ::: 3
* Done. Good. But still some scaling issues.

Nasty "-" rendering in OpenGL for charged atoms in HUD Ligand ::: 0.5
* Done 375716e7198e9df624449790378d383daa4f6370

Views ::: 2
* Simple implementation

Open dictionary should provide a widget to specify the molecule for dictionary.
Also a "Generate Molecule" button. ::: 0.4

Clemens: If I mutate a residue with hydrogen atoms, make the new atoms have hydrogen atoms too.
It would be good if you could make them nucleus hydrogens if that's what was deleted. ::: 1

Clicking on Green left arrow doesn't open the refinement overlay ::: 1
* Done.

Shift the HUD ligand 10 pixels to the right, i.e. add 0.02 to x in the shaders. ::: 0.5
* Done.

In graphics_info_t::new_fill_combobox_with_coordinates_options() gtk_combo_box_set_active() doesn't work.
Why? Because it's looked up and not new? ::: 2
* Done. 215d1cf6eb4c55a3a2fe66c6437df17983f19da5. Maybe more like this.

Quick save should say something in the status-bar - maybe briefly flash and fade the background. Or some
other brief visual effect. ::: 0.5
* Done.

Looks at 1x8b with ligands and contact dots - is 2.0 too close for H-O hydrogen bond distance?
No, it's fine: see https://proteopedia.org/wiki/index.php/Hydrogen_bonds. Contact dots has it as
a clash though. "The dotted hydrogen bond is non-covalent and variable in length, ~1.5-2.5 Å." ::: 1
* Done in refinement.

Bug: Add Hydrogen atoms fails for 1x8b/824 - missing on N :: 4
Something to do with the dictionary? No. With new dictionary it still fails. The type for N is NR5.
This is wrong. It should be NR15. So, when the atom type is NR5, then check the bonds to the atom, to see
if there is an N-H bond.
* Done.

Search monomer library results should be left-hand justified ::: 0.5
* Done

Search monomer library results should have rdkit images? ::: 0.5
* Done

Isolated Molprobity dots for this ligand - what is this? How is it different to contact dots for ligand?
   contact_score_ligand_func(). Hmm. See ~/Desktop/ligand-notes
* Contact dots for ligand is my function - it has vdw dots

Shader Preferences can submarine ::: 0.2
* Done.

Find somewhere for coot.set_b_factor_bonds_scale_factor ::: 1
* Preferences, surely.

Something is wrong with the generation of the guile code. ::: 0.2
* No... it was just not compillled wth guile. Still startup issues need
  to be resolved, I think.

Fix the dynamic validation pane resize on Update of the buttons ::: 0.2
* Done. gtk_paned_get_position().

Pulling on atoms during refinement doesn't work with trackpad on macOS. ::: 2
* Done. Let's see how it integrates with regular mouse usage.

Do the tutorial from time to time - what's missing? ::: 1
* Nothing. It works.

Full-fat render path - i.e. framebuffer need to be set up correctly (at the right time?) ::: 2
set_framebuffer_scale_factor().
Well this works just like gtk3 version does. No effect on the framebuffer using "Fancy" path and
shows a quadrant in "Plane" mode. The output tga file is full-resolution though, which is nice.
Don't confuse the scaling of the framebuffer for screenshot (in "Plain" mode) and
the scaling of the framebuffers for super-sampling (in "Fancy" mode).
* Now the framebuffer scaling for the basic/simple mode work (fat density lines appear)

Preferences -> Colours -> Font does not work ::: 1

How do I invoke the sequence view? ::: 0.1
* Add a menu item

Ligands in 6l01 and 7tzz fall off the page
* Improved. Still needs work.

How do I dismiss the sequence view? ::: 1
* Done.

From Stuart: 1h27 fails on read cif. ::: 1
Make Coot use GEMMI.
* Done.

Open Check/Delete Waters dialog twice.
I want alignment by using a Grid.
I want distance in the button label.
I want the results box to be docked.
It needs an extra distance criterion for distance to a hydrogen atom. ::: 2


Make the run-script dialog be transient ::: 0.2
* Done.

add a "Grab focus" before going in to fullscreen! ::: 0.5
* Done.

Turn on Intermediate atom All-atom contact dots, refine and accept. The contact dots

* Done.

Tweak down the perspective a notch.
* Done.

Is the em radius saved to the state file? :: 0.2
It is now.

Are the cis-peptides markers being generated and displayed? ::: 1

  The SSAO for model is not anisotropic now that we use the new instanced code (if it ever was).
  The SSAO for map is though. Compare and constrast with the model shaders.
* Done. Yay.

Proportional editing ::: 1
* Done. Nice.

Make Local distances restraints 5 ::: 1
* Done. Nice.

The Restraints menu needs a "Delete Extra Restraints" button. ::: 0.5
* Done. Nice.

Go into CA mode and try to middle-mouse over an atom that is not displayed. The recentering works.
The atom picker needs to know about the representation type (or act on it) ::: 0.1
* Can't reproduce (thankfully?)

Make sure that set_scroll_wheel_map and set_scrollable_map() (how are they different?) change the scroll indicator
in the Display Manager. ::: 0.5
* Done.

Don't draw cis-peptide markup for an MDO ::: 0.8
* Done. Pretty tricky.

Blog tutorial: why do we change the default B-factor? ::: 0.2
* Done.

Fetch EMDB map doesn't check the cache/coot-download.
* It does now.

No reaction to Validate -> Atoms with Zero Occs (there were some) ::: 0.5
* Done.

Fix this: ::: 1
"widget main_window_meshes_frame was not found"
* Done. Mow there is a ribbons dialog

Missing difference map peaks in 1bl8 from Oliver Clarke. ::: 1
* Done

a7956aa695f8c19e52622447ca292434812d4e62. ::: 0.1
How about deleting the timeout altogether?
* OK, done.

Moorhen: Fourier filter jiggle fit:
* Done.

Moorhen: read_ccp4_map() with the wrong file name
* Done.

Moorhen: map histogram - user chooses number of bins, I guess 50?
* Done.

Moorhen: libcootapi neeeds to return the columns that it has read in auto-read.
* Done.

Fix the R/RC combo-box changed handlers.
* Done.

Colour by B-factor CA is wrong: test with tutorial and 8oie.
          B-factor all doesn't work at all.
* Done.

Missing validation items: Some currently under Draw -> Molecule
   "Residues with Alt Confs" and
   "Residues with Missing Atoms"
   "Residue with cis-peptide" action needs to be filled
   "Residue type selection" action needs to be filled  <- This one remains to be done.
* Done. A bit of a fudge and what a grind - boring.

Clicking the switch Refine -> GM Restraints doesn't undisplay the GM restraints.
* Done. Easy.

Put 7vvl in CA mode. You can label atoms that are not displayed. Bad.
* Can't reproduce.

Moorhen: carbon bonds are too light on white background. Looking at the code, it seems
         to do the right thing, but needs testing. Print the colour table.
* Colour table seems fine. Needs a look.
* Done. Not a libcootapi problem.

sharpen_blur_with_resampling to moorhen api
* Done.

Save coordinates chooser and dialog is broken.
* Done.

Copy Fragment buttons need more space.
* Jakub Done.

* Still broken?
*   Looks OK to me now.

no_sound()
* Done.

Moorhen: Check/Delete waters function for the api
* Done.

Moorhen: test robustness of jiggle-fitting. Move the molecule around a bit and
         see if you get solutions.
         Use the nanobody in 7vvl.
         Use one of the WD40 domains in 6eoj
* Done - good enough for now

Moorhen: Read gziped maps in libcootapi, so moorhen can get maps from emdb.
* Done.

Moorhen: auto-read-mtz needs to return the Fobs and sigFobs also (if possible, of course)
  add std::string F_obs and sigF_obs to auto_read_mtz_info_t
  They were not set if F_obs is empty.
* Done

Apply Charles patches.
* Done.

"Solidify maps" in Cryo-EM module menu
* Done

No sound api.
* Done.

Outliers only in Rama plots
* Done.

Residues-near-residues
* Done.

Use "updating maps" a second time.
* Done. Added protection.

coot.halloween()
* Done.

Moorhen:: check waters: change the return type so that there is a label or some such.
(or the reason why it was an outlier)
* Already done

Rebuild RDKit, check that Eigen is pulled in correctly.
* Done.

GUI: Where is pepflip Q in the key-bindings?.
* Done.

GUI: "Use Trans-peptide restraints" button doesn't work (the button is on again
    when the dialog is displayed again).
* Done.

GUI: --auto moorhen-tutorial-4.mtz doesn't auto-read the Fobs colums, so the
     auto-updating maps doesn't work sadly.
* Done

Martin Moncrieffe: distance and angles on Mac.
* Done.

libcootapi: estimate the molecule radius - using the distance between 1000 (say) random atom pairs.
* Done.

Is it a good idea for the wasm build from CCP4_WASM_BUILD/moorhen_build compiles test-molecules-container?
How do I use it?
* It might be a good idea, but it is not at all important.

Key-binding for "display/undisplay all maps"
* Done - sort of. Shift Q

Key-binding for "toggle display of last model"
* Done - Shift A.

Key-binding for "Advance scroll-wheel-map to next map" (have I done this?)
* Yes. Shift W

moorhen: atom selection for Mg was grey, not green as it should be.
Even with non-carbon colouring it failed. Using custom rule (from the "+" button)
* Fixed.

moorhen: does the map masking take a multi-cid for the atom selection?
* It does not. Tested.
* Fixed.

Coot:: In the display manager "atom selection from x" should be "atom selection //D from x"
* Done.

Coot: make the function get_number_of_molecules(), as an alias maybe.
* Done.

Coot: Add to Draw menu "Activate Scene Preset" Figure making or Model-building
* Done. Good.

Coot: write a script that reads a map and undisplays it (positron). Now open the Display Manager.
   The map "Display" checkbuttons are on.
*Done.

Coot: check that a Gaussian chain surface should be displayed before using it in the SSAO image.
*Done.
