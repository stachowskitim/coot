"View Grid Mode" - give each molecule a possible screen offset (given the center of the screen is at 0,0)
   say (-0.5, 0.5), (0.5, 0.5), (-0.5, -0.5), (0.5, -0.5) - for ligand diagrams or overlapped structure or
   cryo-EM maps set_view_grid_mode(2,2) and some sort of assignment of molecules to grid.
   Allow the user to change the grid of a molecule: set_view_grid_mode_grid_for_molecule(imol, irow, icol)
   set_view_grid_mode_auto (and it will work out the grid (say for 15 molecules/map)).

How do I make vertex-gradients work for maps? Have I done this already? How do I turn it on? I'd like a function
and a key-binding if nothing else.

Hydrogen bond Bug: 7h76 ligand B206 : pink (H-bond) between ligand O and A8 O should not be allowed
by geometry (it goes backwards) or chemistry (they are both acceptors). Is this in Coot too?

libcootapi MoleculesToTriangles:
  o No secondary structure (worms)
  o Input secondary structure
  o Calculate secondary structure

when starting graphics on Mac: use 1508 x 1364, rather than the current narrow values.

chapi.__version__ should be a thing (Martin)
* Don't see how
set_ligand_water_to_protein_distance_limits() needs to added to nanobindings
* Done.
water baddies is missing from nanobindings too.
* Done.
add user-control over level for deleting waters.
* Done.
add_waters should return the waters that have been added.
* Meh - OK.
What about the b-factor variation of added waters that Coot now does?
  - That B-factor is applied, it seems.
* Done.

libcootapi: add a function to add an atom at a particular position.

despeckle tomograms:

Coot: shadows don't work on Ribbons/M2T objects

Coot: Get servalcat working - and difference maps - so it can be added to the Trieste talk.

libcootapi: Reverse the order of the colour rule check for gaussian surfaces.
   Don't overwrite the colour rules when they get added (reverse the recent change)
   String matching the colour rule is not good - what about the rule
   "//A,B" "red"?
* Done/sorted for now.

Oxygens and nitrogens should be made transparent if the colour rule (selection) would
make them transparent if it could.

Getters for M2T_updateFloatParameter and M2T_updateIntParameter
  What things can be set? Post in pumble.
* Done.

Coot: 1: add a button for "difference map" in map reading dialog.

Coot libs: "thread fill sections" - is debugging I think - get rid of it. But try the
   new method first.

Coot: what did Oleg say about AlphaFold3 PAE?

Coot Bug: turn on rotamer restraints, turn on torsion restraints - has the trans restraints been removed?
   (noticed in refinement branch)

Coot: add something so that I can look down the axes - particularly z.

Coot: add a means to say that P1 maps can have symmetry:
   https://github.com/pemsley/coot/issues/67

Coot: look at the 2b0m flavin ligand interactions - diego where it looks like a hydrogen bond.

Coot: no coot prefix in map saved in status file coot.handle_read_ccp4_map
* Done.

Coot: we have meshed_generic_display_object::add_point(). We want meshed_generic_display_object::add_points()
  Say for example the bendy helices project - many points means coot is slow to start up.
* Done.

libcootapi: Molecule2Triangles: the bases are inside-out relative to the ribbon.
* Done.

moorhen: 8hcl F chain negative numbers for residue range doesn't work it seems?

Coot: What do I need to do for each of FLEV, CFC and QED? Do it soon.

   QED:  ..?
   FLEV: Does this need to be in Layla? I think not, in fact. Goocanvas stuff will
         need to be converted to Cairo. And I can display the cairo surface like I do
         in the positron interface.
   CFC:  Needs a C++ clustering algorithm. Before I used Gaussian mixture model - maybe that will do.
         Needs to be available in Moorhen.

* Done.

Coot: I want a slider to scrub through the map molecules in positron interface.
      It would be good if this scrubbed the fitted models too (models need to be fitted first - haha)

Don't allow FLEV if the protein doesn't have hydrogen atoms. Provide a button to do it.

libcootapi: import glTF (from Mol*, say!)

ligand fitting tutorial - turn around the tail of the fish so that it is the wrong way
and look at the environment distances - the O-O interaction should not be purple!

Coot: generic objects are not drawn with depth fog

Coot: update molecule when input model file have updates?
   set_update_model_when_file_updates() - only for unmodified models of course.

mmdb: atom selection with alt conformer - write a test and fix mmdb.

Coot: Why do we need requests? Can't it be done by libcurl or internal python module urllib?
      See fetch_drug_via_wikipedia() in coot_utils.

Coot: rsr_refine_all_atoms() only refines the chain
* Done.

Coot: (refinement) martin maly bug: transpose map by lsq superpose failed.

      (Restore functionality).
* Done.

Coot: 4qpq: It is making DNA base pair restraints as I hoped?
* Seems so from the behaviour, but I don't see it in the terminal

Coot: Ribbons mode needs (an option?) to add ligands 6zxa.cif

Coot: for sound, look at tw/cootsound.c

Coot: on the command line, coot --dict thing.cif should give a molecule, not just read in the cif
      if there are no coordinates arguments.

Layla: Garib: I want the ability to change charge and bond orders.
    Also: See this: http://rdkit.blogspot.com/2019/11/introducing-new-rdkit-javascript.html
    which points to this: https://rdkit.org/rdkitjs/beta/demo.html

Test ligand fitting of fitligand binary. Using conformation variation and not.

libcootapi: what do we need to get flev working?

libcootapi: give me tautomers of this molecule/ligand.

chapi: what about bringing servalcat into the chapi installation? And to build-it-3-3?

libcootapi: in protein_geometry add a function something like
   duplicate_dictionary_for_other_molecule(int idx_rest, int imol_other)
   so that dictionaries assigned to a particular molecule can be used by other molecules (e.g. in dragged refinement).
   The molecules_container api will be duplicate_dictionary_for_other_molecule(comp_id, imol_current, imol_other)

libcootapi: when generating conformers, throw away the conformers that have many nbcs (don't do minimization)

libcootapi: move secondary structure header info int SSEs of residue (does this function exist already?)

libcootapi: remove the sphere test when generating map contours
 - Why?
 - Would it be faster to trim them afterwards?

libcootapi: remove static things in the molecules_container

libcootapi: make auto-fit-rotamer work without a map (if it doesn't already)

libcootapi: hydrogen bonds and other interactions to a residue?

Coot: Save Coords is not working again.
* It works OK, on mac, so I think that it's a GTK4 bug.

Coot: what does electrostatics give us now?

For next week: local resolution display in Moorhen

libcootapi: set_user_defined_atom_colour_by_selection() should not be given a vector of pairs,
  it should be a vector of triples (trivial class) { selection_string, colour_index, Cs-only-flag }

libcootapi: what happens when the ligands don't match?

libcootapi: put gesamt into the build (build-it-3-3)

libcootapi: change the SSM arg order to match ligand function: moving first.

libcootapi: to release std::vector memory use std::swap on an empty vector, not mere assignment

libcootapi: bring in transpose map by lsq superposition

libcootapi: check the return type/value of match_torsion_and_postion()
* Done. It's not clever.

libcootapi: non-carbon rules should be per rule not per molecule

libcootapi: environ distances are not symmetry aware - they should be. Q: are they in Coot?

libcootapi: /Users/pemsley/Projects/Moorhen/checkout/coot-1.0/api/add-terminal-residue.cc:9:9: warning: 'HAVE_BOOST_BASED_THREAD_POOL_LIBRARY' macro redefined [-Wmacro-redefined]

libcootapi: nice to have position restraints for ligand+env minimization

libcootapi: are backups being made by refine()?. If so, turn them off - maybe backup at start?

libcootapi: before Newcastle: torsion match ligand and ligand graph-based superposition
 * Done - but needs more work

libcootapi: the apply colour rules to non-carbon atoms need to happen on a per-colour-rule basis, not per molecule.
  so that ligands can be set a different colour in Goodsel mode - and goodsel mode plays nicely with other colour rules.

libcootapi fix the apply_user_defined_atom_colour_selections() so that it uses atoms, not residue selection.

libcootapi: remove ligands and waters

libcootapi: renumber residue range

libcootapi: make an ensemble from a list of molecules

     Why? (Note that the "Get Monomer" from the acedrg dictionary works OK - no flying Hydrogen atoms).

Science: Get the Cryo-EM servalcat difference map working

Science: analytical gradients for Gaussian surfaces

Science: Make a exponential_approx function that uses a pre-calculated table
         and use it to make smooth normals for the vertices of a gaussian surface.
         Extra points for multi-threading.

Useful: multi-thread the rmsd calculation, so that the Coot points
        calculation in cryo-EM maps is fast(er).

Science: middle of blob for EM jiggle-fitting, try 3908?

Science: "One button" post-jiggle fit "black box morph refine"

   Tricky thing is to find interesting cases.

Science/Useful: Calculate the RSR contact dots only for atoms with in ~12 A (say) of the

If it moved then tell me previous fit score and current fit score.

GUI: Fix the undo molecule chooser (have 2 molecules with edits)


---- older issues ---

Auto-centre the user-suggestion for the centre of the blob when using
jiggle-fit. c.f. "Place Helix Here" initial centering.

Typical example of "what to do?"
  - Filo has been trying the Coot EM tutorial in Moorhen and finds some problem with
    "jiggle fit" - this is an interesting scientific problem - how far can you be away
  - Bogged down in tracking events and model coordinates and mesh and drawing updates
    for rotation/translation
  - Chatting with Jakub about Shortcuts but making no progress

Ribbons don't cast shadows.

No reaction to Aligment vs PIR (no PIR was loaded)

Size and user-defined "screen axis" displacement of atom labels, e.g. [0,0,5] to bring
the label towards the camera.

Issue 67:
On reflection, I will add a function that allows the user to override Coot's attempt to determine the EM-state of the map.

Layla: make python setup be available for Coot and Layla - put it in its own directory. So that layla
is not linked with src files.

Rob's problematic links
* Need details.

startup with default map opacity.

Jakub: sugar representation in RDKit and layla? (add it?) Tricky.

Where is Make Link? ::: 1.5
* Needs user-defined click click. Just do it in C++?
* Note that Make Link via Acedrg also needs user-defined click click (or a rewrite).

Colour rules (like Moorhen) need to be added to the Coot API.

Rewrite moorhen ligand fitting to use a vector of threads, not the thread pool.
* Low priority

Pyrogen needs to work ::: 2

Greg Crichlow cifs

Full-fat render path - i.e. framebuffer need to be set up correctly (at the right time?) ::: 2
set_framebuffer_scale_factor().
Well this works just like gtk3 version does. No effect on the framebuffer using "Fancy" path and
shows a quadrant in "Plane" mode. The output tga file is full-resolution though, which is nice.
Don't confuse the scaling of the framebuffer for screenshot (in "Plain" mode) and
the scaling of the framebuffers for super-sampling (in "Fancy" mode).
OK, so the framebuffer scaling works in simple mode.
Make it work in "fancy" mode and I will call it done.

Missing Bernie cherries

Fix build for St Judes Walid

2koc: do a Coot contact dots analysis on it.

Try using the instanced bonds using the api. Fix the specular lighting.

Test the conversion of glm quaternion to coot quaternion and back again. OK, done.
Test are in place. Now try again with the ligand orientation.

What about coot --no-graphics?

What about coot --version?

Fix crash on coot.coot_real_exit(0)
OK, so framebuffers are being deconstructed after call to exit().
It seem that framebuffers need to be deconstructed while the GL context is valid.
So it seems to me that they should be deconstructed as graphics_info_t is deconstructed. So add
their teardown() functions to ~graphics_info_t(). That prevents the crash I think.
However, the init_joey_ssao_stuff() are not initializing SSAO-gBuffer-framebuffer and effects-framebuffer
it seems. Yet they are being bound somewhere. Investigate further later by turning on fancy mode.
See partial-patch-for-framebuffer-teardown.patch.
Now I will revert.

Put the gtk version in the build_type? Currently Linux-x86_64-ubuntu-21.10-gtk4

I want to be able use "Fancy" shader path, but not use SSAO.

Rotation in Proportional Editing

Do we get Diegos for bad backbone neightbours O3' bumping int 05'? We
would need them for validating RNA backbone torsions.

Colour by chain (and dict?) but not by atom - i.e. how colour-by-chain used to work. This gives us
a nicer representation of ribosomes.

Use a state script for 2 model molecules - the first of which is undisplayed. The display manager
doesn't show that it's undisplayed ::: 0.6

Restore the draw() function in draw_ghost_bonds() in molecule-class-info.cc - needs a new class to do so.

In Moorhen, it's nice to work with the contact dots on. When I improve the fit and remove a clash, I want
to see something like the Moorhen points (but for the clash score, of course).

Make auto_read_mtz return the column labels - for Moorhen.

Undo molecule chooser should be an overlay.

"Accent Background" - 1: replace the blank background with a texture. 2: Make a texture using the current image

It just needs a bit of adjustment of the margins.
* Looks fine.

Get the "Map..." Button working. ::: 0.5

Can you make the rotamer dialog be an overlay? Not important. ::: 0
* No go to do this yet.

I think that one of the new buttons steals the focus from the graphics on startup now. ::: 0.5
* Done.

Key-binding for "clear all atom labels" ::: 0.25

* Done. Nice

Cell and Symmetry looks ugly - make it dynamic so the only button is "Close" ::: 1
* Done - good enough for now

Enable basic files on the command line ::: 4

Consider using double-click to do go to blob.  Where does "label atom" go then? Or how about middle-mouse on blob?
(pressing "G" on the keyboard is not intuitive). ::: 0.2
Double-click to recentre (G: go to blob) ::: 0.3
* Done. Let's see if I like it.

Draw -> Molecule -> Bond colours ::: 1
* A lot better.

How do I add a single water? ::: 0.5
* Added to key-bindings for now.  Take care to add it to the correct molecule though

When I am adding waters, don't let me add to the molecule if it is not displayed. ::: 0.2

File -> Delete Molecules dialog ::: 1
* Done. Nice.

Edit -> Residue Info: Fix up the dialog and toggle buttons ::: 2.5
* Done. What a grind. At least a 2.

Better/more completions and history in python scripting. ::: 3
* Done. What a grind!

Background colour ::: 0.4
* Done. Trivial

Pointer distances ::: 0.5
* They were mostly done already. Just the dialog needed cleaning up.
  It should be an overlay one day

Click on symmetry atoms ::: 1

Add back the icons in the info dialog ::: 1

"Add New Residue Type" in the "Add Other Solvent Molecules" dialog doesn't work ::: 0.5

Wed  3 May 2023 14:43:36 BST
check the HUD NBC blocks in 89A - shouldn't lots of them be be labelled with "this residue" marker? ::: 0.4
* Done. Now both atoms are added for the same NBC.

GtkGrid in Residue Info doesn't get cleared before a new residue widgets are added. ::: 0.4
* Delete all the children: clear_the_grid():

Make a better descision about which molecule is the one used for "place typed atom at pointer (water)" ::: 0.2

Make the Fast-go-to-residue dialog be an overlay? No. A transient will do for now. ::: 0.5

Fix "Edit Chi Angles" button ::: 1

Wed  3 May 2023 14:43:36 BST
check the HUD NBC blocks in 89A - shouldn't lots of them be be labelled with "this residue" marker? ::: 1

Restore ^C interrupt (python-related?) ::: 1

Add contact dots ::; 1
* Done.

* Added to my key_bindings.py for now

Bring Python command history and completion into GTK4: ::: 2
   a9d101aa69a767583a085de9e3c8ae2449fe71fa
   3fc6cfe003683ab1180c0045387036068cc32294

Generic Display Objects is a mess ::: 2
* Much better now!

* Done.

Add highly-coordinated waters ::: 0.7
* Done. Nice

Delete on a Water fails (it works if "Residue" is selected) ::: 0.4

Find Somewhere for "Choose Undo Molecule" ::: 0.5
* Done. Hooray.

Put a bar/cyclinder under Diego so I can see the atoms. ::: 2
* Lovely interactive contact dots will do.

Find somewhere in refinement module for "Contact dots during refinement" ::: 0.0
* Already exists in the "Refine" module!

HOLE ::: 1

Making the window larger exposes more of the validation pane - even without validation graphs present ::: 1
No longer. But make the startup window wider. now app window is 1000x900.

Dotted Surface ::: 1
* This exits and it draws OK, but I don't see how to change the colour yet.
  Changing the colour is very tricky beacuse balls is not part of the coot::dots_representation_info_t
  class. Perhaps it should be? (see add_dots()).

7a0l.cif doesn't load from the command line (related to 7a0l-assembly.cif non-load, I guess).
It's a molecule not a dictionary. The command_line::add() function needs to detect the difference.
All molecule .cif files fail to load on the command line? e.g. 7uv7
Now, should this be "nice to have" or "must have"?
* Done.

Sharpen/Blur (mtz) map is missing ::: 1

Built-in key-binding for [,]. ::: 0.2

Open, close, reopen Bond Parameters, An extra molecule combobox is added. ::: 0.5

Check the links in all representation types (use PDB files) ::: 2
* 7a0l not perfect in colour-by-B and occ. Good enough for now.

Draw fixed atoms - anchors seems not to be working. Also, Angry Diegos are missing. Is this only on MacOS? ::: 1.0
* It works on the PC.
* Error in the shader.

Where are the rotating hydrogen bonds? ::: 0.5
Calculate -> Hydrogen Bonds?

7a0l colour by B-factor with fat bonds. Bonds to hydrogen atoms are grey and fat. ::: 2
* Fat bonds partial fix for B-factor and Occ modes.

Apply the symmetry colour from the Cell and Symmetry dialog ::: 1
* Done. At last. 2 attempts. Looks nice.

Save state via a file chooser dialog and Ctrl-S and use on the command line ::: 1
* Done.

This function needs an extra arg: "bool transfered_colour_is_instanced"
void
Mesh::draw_instanced(Shader *shader_p,
                     const glm::mat4 &mvp,

                     float pulsing_phase_distribution,
                     float z_rotation_angle)

which gets sent to the shader of course. Check that both interactive atomic comtact dots and hydrogen bonds work.
(what else uses that shader?)   ::: 1
* Done.

7a0l-assemby.cif from rscb.org fails to import. Hmm! How to fix that!? Test case for gemmi-based import?
* Done.

Start up from Saved state. ::: 1
For now I can start by passing startup.py on the command line.

Change the label on the Refinement module's "Contact Dots on" menu item ::: 0.1
* Done.

Sort out whatever is going wrong with the display of the extra distance restraints. ::: 1
* Done.

Connect up the distances and angles dialog ::: 1
* It was easy. I could improve the position of the angle label.

Fix the double reading of the monomer library ::: 0.3
* Hopefully this won't break things.

Update the Ramachandran Plot after RSR or other model edits ::: 1
* Done. Nice.

Update the Validation Graphs after RSR or other model edits ::: 2.5
what is this: update_active_validation_graph_model()?
It is the function that gets called when the user changes the molecule in the validation graph dialog.
It is not the function to update the graphs when the model changes.

Validation graph colours ::: 1.0
* Mostly done. Needs some tweaking (e.g. in Density Correlation there needs to be some improved range).

Edit Restraints, Select Monomer type - dialogs messed up ::: 1
* Done.

Restraints Editor ::: 2
* Done.

Calculate -> Map Tools -> Copy Map doesn't work ::: 0.5
* Done. And smoother versions.

Intercept "Get Monomer" or "Search Monomer" 3GP and give me a conformation that fits more easily ::: 1
* Grindy finding the bug (was not editing the correct dictionary).

rename draw-2.cc as tick-function.cc or some such

On changing the selection in the rama plot, it says "now do something with //A". So you should do that. ::: 0.5

Rama plots need to read the imol in on_ramachandran_plot_molecule_chooser_ok_button_clicked() ::: 0.1

Go into perspective project and with left-mouse pressed wave around the mouse wildly ::: 0.2
*Done. Added stabilization in mouse_zoom().

Curlew: Goodsell, speed-run and CaBLAM ::: 5
* Monster effort - rewrite from scratch.

Open Coordinates -> Move Molecule Here -> Open doesn't work  ::: 0.5

Edit->Move Molecule Here... Do it twice and the combobox duplicates ::: 0.5
Needs a check before adding a combobox?
* Done.

Add a window-removed signal callback for Bernie? ::: 0.2
void
window_removed (
  GtkApplication* self,
  GtkWindow* window,
  gpointer user_data
)
* I added a note:

* Done. Commented out a big hunk of code. Make instancing work.

Where is "Add Atom at Pointer"? Do I mean for waters and metals to be added using "Add Other
 Solvent Molecules"? No. Modelling -> Add an Atom: Then can be Water, or anions and cations ::: 1

rename residue, renumber waters, reorder chains, replace fragment, use SEGIDs in Edit menu ::: 0.2
* Done ages ago.

Do the tutorial from time to time - what's missing? ::: 6
graphs, validation graphs colours, updates of rama, clash dots on model change.
change the function name update_validation_graphs() to update_validation() and after that change the name back and call
the dot updates and update_validation_graphs() from there.

Key-binding/function to bump the B-factors up or down or match the neighbourhood. ::: 0.2
* Done

Clear the box of results in Unmodelled Blobs ::: 0.4

   contact_score_ligand_func(). Hmm.
[Ligand Metric Sliders]

"About Coot" is empty (was fixed in GTK3 version). Remake it in Cambalache?  ::: 0.5
* Nearly done - I need to be able to install the icon.


"Ligands" selection in Go To Atom ::: 0.5

"Overlaps" needs an update button - and preferably updates automatically. ::: 3

Edit -> Mutate Residue Range ::: 2
* Done. Thanks Jakub.

Map Parameters dialog needs a refresh ::: 0.5
* Done. Nice

Bug: make Contact Dots, open Generic Objects dialog , Close, Add new contact dot and then open generic objects dialog
again. Mess as some box entries are double written. ::: 1
* Done, I think. Use clear_the_grid()


"Add atom" should boink if the new atom is over/close to an already existing atom ::: 0.5
(Maybe it does already)
* Now I get a warning dialog - good enough

Draw the ligand chemical diagram in OpenGL. ::: 3
* Done. Good. But still some scaling issues.

Nasty "-" rendering in OpenGL for charged atoms in HUD Ligand ::: 0.5
* Done 375716e7198e9df624449790378d383daa4f6370

* Simple implementation

Open dictionary should provide a widget to specify the molecule for dictionary.
Also a "Generate Molecule" button. ::: 0.4

Clemens: If I mutate a residue with hydrogen atoms, make the new atoms have hydrogen atoms too.
It would be good if you could make them nucleus hydrogens if that's what was deleted. ::: 1

Clicking on Green left arrow doesn't open the refinement overlay ::: 1
* Done.

Shift the HUD ligand 10 pixels to the right, i.e. add 0.02 to x in the shaders. ::: 0.5
* Done.

In graphics_info_t::new_fill_combobox_with_coordinates_options() gtk_combo_box_set_active() doesn't work.
Why? Because it's looked up and not new? ::: 2
* Done. 215d1cf6eb4c55a3a2fe66c6437df17983f19da5. Maybe more like this.

Quick save should say something in the status-bar - maybe briefly flash and fade the background. Or some
other brief visual effect. ::: 0.5
* Done.

Looks at 1x8b with ligands and contact dots - is 2.0 too close for H-O hydrogen bond distance?
No, it's fine: see https://proteopedia.org/wiki/index.php/Hydrogen_bonds. Contact dots has it as
a clash though. "The dotted hydrogen bond is non-covalent and variable in length, ~1.5-2.5 Å." ::: 1
* Done in refinement.

Bug: Add Hydrogen atoms fails for 1x8b/824 - missing on N :: 4
Something to do with the dictionary? No. With new dictionary it still fails. The type for N is NR5.
This is wrong. It should be NR15. So, when the atom type is NR5, then check the bonds to the atom, to see
if there is an N-H bond.
* Done.

Search monomer library results should be left-hand justified ::: 0.5
* Done

Search monomer library results should have rdkit images? ::: 0.5
* Done

Isolated Molprobity dots for this ligand - what is this? How is it different to contact dots for ligand?
   contact_score_ligand_func(). Hmm. See ~/Desktop/ligand-notes
* Contact dots for ligand is my function - it has vdw dots

Shader Preferences can submarine ::: 0.2
* Done.

What's up with the Preferences? ::: 6

* Done.

Find somewhere for coot.set_b_factor_bonds_scale_factor ::: 1
* Preferences, surely.

Something is wrong with the generation of the guile code. ::: 0.2
* No... it was just not compillled wth guile. Still startup issues need
  to be resolved, I think.

Fix the dynamic validation pane resize on Update of the buttons ::: 0.2
* Done. gtk_paned_get_position().

Pulling on atoms during refinement doesn't work with trackpad on macOS. ::: 2
* Done. Let's see how it integrates with regular mouse usage.

Do the tutorial from time to time - what's missing? ::: 1
* Nothing. It works.

Full-fat render path - i.e. framebuffer need to be set up correctly (at the right time?) ::: 2
set_framebuffer_scale_factor().
Well this works just like gtk3 version does. No effect on the framebuffer using "Fancy" path and
shows a quadrant in "Plane" mode. The output tga file is full-resolution though, which is nice.
Don't confuse the scaling of the framebuffer for screenshot (in "Plain" mode) and
the scaling of the framebuffers for super-sampling (in "Fancy" mode).
* Now the framebuffer scaling for the basic/simple mode work (fat density lines appear)

Preferences -> Colours -> Font does not work ::: 1

"Atom Label Font Size" frame should be deleted from the properties. ::: 0.5

[ and ] don't change the cryo-EM map radius. ::: 0.2

How do I invoke the sequence view? ::: 0.1
* Add a menu item

Ligands in 6l01 and 7tzz fall off the page
* Improved. Still needs work.

How do I dismiss the sequence view? ::: 1

From Stuart: 1h27 fails on read cif. ::: 1
Make Coot use GEMMI.
* Done.

Open Check/Delete Waters dialog twice.
I want alignment by using a Grid.
I want distance in the button label.
I want the results box to be docked.
It needs an extra distance criterion for distance to a hydrogen atom. ::: 2


Make the run-script dialog be transient ::: 0.2
* Done.

add a "Grab focus" before going in to fullscreen! ::: 0.5
* Done.

Turn on Intermediate atom All-atom contact dots, refine and accept. The contact dots

* Done.

Tweak down the perspective a notch.
* Done.

Is the em radius saved to the state file? :: 0.2
It is now.

Are the cis-peptides markers being generated and displayed? ::: 1

* Done.

Fresnel mode for maps in "Plain" mode ::: 1
* Done.

Bring the script that shows the SSOA buffer to GTK4 and try to fix the aniostropy. ::: 1
  The SSAO for model is not anisotropic now that we use the new instanced code (if it ever was).
  The SSAO for map is though. Compare and constrast with the model shaders.
* Done. Yay.

Proportional editing ::: 1
* Done. Nice.

Make Local distances restraints 5 ::: 1
* Done. Nice.

The Restraints menu needs a "Delete Extra Restraints" button. ::: 0.5
* Done. Nice.

Go into CA mode and try to middle-mouse over an atom that is not displayed. The recentering works.
The atom picker needs to know about the representation type (or act on it) ::: 0.1
* Can't reproduce (thankfully?)

Make sure that set_scroll_wheel_map and set_scrollable_map() (how are they different?) change the scroll indicator
in the Display Manager. ::: 0.5
* Done.

Don't draw cis-peptide markup for an MDO ::: 0.8
* Done. Pretty tricky.

Blog tutorial: why do we change the default B-factor? ::: 0.2
* Done.

Fetch EMDB map doesn't check the cache/coot-download.
* It does now.

No reaction to Validate -> Atoms with Zero Occs (there were some) ::: 0.5
* Done.

Fix this: ::: 1
"widget main_window_meshes_frame was not found"
* Done. Mow there is a ribbons dialog

Missing difference map peaks in 1bl8 from Oliver Clarke. ::: 1
* Done

a7956aa695f8c19e52622447ca292434812d4e62. ::: 0.1

* Done.

Missing validation items: Some currently under Draw -> Molecule
   "Residues with Alt Confs" and
   "Residues with Missing Atoms"
   "Residue with cis-peptide" action needs to be filled
   "Residue type selection" action needs to be filled  <- This one remains to be done.
* Done. A bit of a fudge and what a grind - boring.

Clicking the switch Refine -> GM Restraints doesn't undisplay the GM restraints.
* Done. Easy.

Put 7vvl in CA mode. You can label atoms that are not displayed. Bad.
* Can't reproduce.

Moorhen: carbon bonds are too light on white background. Looking at the code, it seems
         to do the right thing, but needs testing. Print the colour table.
* Colour table seems fine. Needs a look.
* Done. Not a libcootapi problem.

sharpen_blur_with_resampling to moorhen api
* Done.

Save coordinates chooser and dialog is broken.
* Done.

Copy Fragment buttons need more space.

* Already done

Rebuild RDKit, check that Eigen is pulled in correctly.
* Done.

GUI: Where is pepflip Q in the key-bindings?.
* Done.
