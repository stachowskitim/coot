Fedora 40! Welcome to the party!

Prompted in part by _mysecondnameisdanger_ [1] I have spent quite a lot of this month (off and on) trying to get _Coot_ to compile on Fedora.

And now, I am pleased to announce, it seems that I have succeeded!

From a bare-bones workstation installation, one needs to install some prerequisite packages:
```
   - dnf install patch
   - dnf install m4
   - dnf install g++
   - dnf install libtool
   - dnf install cmake
   - dnf install swig
   - dnf install flex
   - dnf install bison
   - dnf install perl
   - dnf install texinfo
   - dnf install gfortran
   - dnf install gtk4-devel
   - dnf install libjpeg-devel
   - dnf install libepoxy-devel
   - dnf install ncurses-devel
   - dnf install lapack-devel
```
(You can put multiple packages on the command line of course)

Then the [build-it-3-3 script](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pemsley/coot/main/build-it-3-3) will just run and build everything that _Coot_ needs, soup to nuts, including _Coot_ itself.
By default the installation directory is a subdirectory in `$HOME/autobuild`. It should take about an hour to compile.

The user interface of Fedora 40 is based around GTK 4.14 and this is what _Coot_ uses too - and is compiled with GCC 14. Just like the rest of the desktop, _Coot_ should be snappy and attractive-looking. Truth to tell, I have not actually seen it myself - I have only used it on the command line via a virtual machine.

Enjoy.
