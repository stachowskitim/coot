Yoshitaka Moriwaki!

Yoshitaka has navigated the maze of adding Coot to Homebrew!  So now it has been accepted by brewsci/bio.
That is important because now all one needs to do to install Coot on Hombrew is:

```brew install brewsci/bio/coot```

and for the bleeding edge:

```brew install brewsci/bio/coot --HEAD```

Woooh!
