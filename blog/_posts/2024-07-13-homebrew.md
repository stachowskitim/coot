I have recently been recommending the installation of Coot via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) on macOS.

It is currently not as straightforward as I would like however. Hopefully things will be improved in the future.

One would like to (just) use:

```brew install coot```

... but that doesn't work at the moment. So one has to download a formula.

The official home of the formula is from Yoshitaka Moriwaki's GitHub:

[https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YoshitakaMo/homebrew-bio/coot/Formula/coot.rb](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/YoshitakaMo/homebrew-bio/coot/Formula/coot.rb)

That sometimes doesn't work, so from time to time I update a backup/work-around script:

[https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/personal/pemsley/coot/files/coot.rb](https://www2.mrc-lmb.cam.ac.uk/personal/pemsley/coot/files/coot.rb)

Having downloaded that `coot.rb` file, the incantation is as follows:

```brew install ./coot.rb --HEAD```

If you have aleady installed a coot via Homebrew, you will need to delete it first:

```brew uninstall coot```

Good luck and all that, people!
