There are very few user-visible changes for this release, but many under-the-hood changes in preparation for distribution by Debian.

   o FEATURE: Scene Presets added to the Draw menu

   o CHANGE:  "Mutate" is now a button so that it can now be
     used to mutate RNA and DNA [Simon Vecchioni].

   o BUG-FIX: mutate_by_overlap() fixed [thanks Simon Vecchioni]

   o BUG-FIX: The "Generic Display Objects" dialog now dynamically
      updates (no need to close it an open it again to see new
      generic display objects).
